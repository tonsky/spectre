 Sessions
==========

Session provides a name/value map associated with a specific browser "connection" to the web server.
   
You can inject session to your view using 'Session session' view arg (recommended) or find it in :attr:`Req.context` as ``req.context["session"]``.
   
.. note::
   Sessions will only be avaliable after :class:`SessionMiddleware` is executed. 
      
To make sessions work, you should specify a session store to define a way you want your sesisons to be stored. For now, spectre offers only one type of store: :class:`InmemoreSessionStore`.
   
   
.. class:: Session

   .. function:: Obj? get(Str k)
   
      Return value stored in session.
      
   .. function:: This set(Str k, Obj? v)
   
      Store value in session.

   .. attribute:: map
   
      This is a map of values stored in the current session. Note that this field will usually be read-only, use :func:`set` to set/change value in session.
